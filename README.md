# php-functions
A personal compilation of general purpouse functions to speed up PHP projects

###Note:
The current status is a little messy because i was collecting this code from many sources with a minimal documentation, even mixed language as spanish/english.

###What's next?
Eventually i'll be cleaning and documenting all the functions to get a more organized document, but for now i think that it's only works for me, so if you found it useful, feel free to download use or modify as you want.
