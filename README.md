#php-functions
A personal compilation of general purpouse functions to speed up PHP projects

###Note:
The current status is a little messy because i was collecting this code from many sources with a minimal documentation, even mixed language as spanish/english.

Just to be clear, some parts of this code has written by me and any other were taken from communities like stackoverflow and adapted by me, so on that cases i put a link to the original source.

###What's next?
Eventually i'll be cleaning and documenting all the functions to get a more organized document, but for now i think that it's only works for me, so if you found it useful, feel free to download use or modify as you want.
