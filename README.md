#php-functions

A personal compilation of general purpouse functions to speed up PHP projects

###Note: 

The current status is a little messy because i was collecting this code from many sources with a minimal documentation, even mixed language as spanish/english.

Just to be clear, some parts of this code has been written by me, and other parts were taken from communities like stackoverflow and adapted or modified by me, so on that cases, i have put a link to the original source.

###What's next? 

Eventually i'll be cleaning and documenting all the functions to get a more organized document, but for now i think that it's only works for me, so if you found it useful, feel free to download use or modify as you want.
